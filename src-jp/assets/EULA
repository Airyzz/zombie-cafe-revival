The Beeline Games made available by Beeline Interactive, Inc. ("Licensor") through the Android Market are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each Beeline Game that you obtain through the Android Market is subject to your prior acceptance of EULA, and you agree that the terms of this EULA will apply to each Beeline Game that you license through the Android Market.  Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Beeline Games not expressly granted to you under this EULA.

a. Scope of License: This license granted to you by Licensor is limited to a nontransferable license to use the Beeline Game on any device running an Android operating system ("Device") that you own or control and as permitted by the rules set forth in the Android Market Terms of Service (the "Usage Rules"). This license does not allow you to use the Beeline Game on any Device that you do not own or control.  You may not distribute or make the Beeline Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer redistribute, or sublicense the Beeline Game and, if you sell your Device to a third party, you must remove the Beeline Game from the Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Beeline Game, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Licensor. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.

The terms of this license will govern any upgrades provided by Licensor that replace and/or supplement the original Beeline Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.

In-App Purchase: The Beeline Game may include functionality that enables you to purchase additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the Beeline Game ("In App Purchases").  In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the Beeline Game (for example, virtual berries) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is purchased and received by you, Licensor shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In App Purchases are deemed Beeline Game, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.
