		<li>
			<h3>Caf&#233; Menu</h3>
			These are the buttons on the left side of the main caf&#233; screen.
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Tap the Zombie Caf&#233; logo to return to the Main Menu.</li>
				<li>Tap the shopping bag icon to open the store. You can drag items out of the store to buy them, or drag items from your caf&#233; back into the store to sell them.</li>
				<li>Tap the map icon to view your neighborhood map, where you can raid other caf&#233;s and visit friends.</li>
				<li>Tap the clipboard icon to view pending orders and attacks your friends have made and to see a tally of your successful attacks and defenses.</li>
				<li>Tap the book icon to view your recipe book and browse your unlocked recipes. The left/right arrows will flip between recipes, and the up/down arrows will show rare/special versions of recipes. Touching a recipe will set it on an open stove to cook, but you will still need to select a worker to tell them to cook it.</li>
				<li>Tap the zombie icon to view bios of your current staff (and optionally fire them to make room). The number underneath this icon represents how many employees you have, out of your current limit.</li>
			</ul>
			When these areas have something new that's of interest, there will be a bouncing exclamation mark above them.
		</li>
		<a name="awning"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Caf&#233; Awning</h3>
			This is the information displayed at the top of the main caf&#233; screen.
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Under "Your Caf&#233;" is your caf&#233;'s star rating. Your rating indicates your caf&#233;'s current popularity, and will go up or down depending on the consistency of your service, and what items you have in your caf&#233;. Keep serving food to get a higher rating and more customers.  More customers means more money!</li>
				<li>To the right of "Your Caf&#233;" is your caf&#233;'s level number and XP (experience) progress bar. Keep cooking and raiding to gain XP - with every level you unlock new recipes, competitors, zombies, and new items in the store!</li>
				<li>To the right of the XP bar are your current supplies of cash and Toxin. Get more cash by serving and raiding.  Get more Toxin by coming back every day to cook, winning raids, or by purchasing it.</li>
				<li>In the top right is the Get More Toxin button. You can use your Google Play account to buy Toxin.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>Touch the door at any time to close the caf&#233;. Your star rating will slowly drop while it is closed.
		</li>
<a name="avatars"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Chef Avatar</h3>
			If you decide you want to change your chef avatar, select your chef and then press the "chef" button to view all of the available avatars. (This list will be updated periodically.) Zombie chefs will have a higher energy/defense when your friends raid your caf&#233;, making it harder for them to win. These are roughly equivalent to the strength that each of these zombie types would have as an employee. An exclamation point will appear over the chef button when new avatars are available.
		</li>

		<a name="cooking"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Cooking</h3>
			Select a stove to bring up the
			recipe book and choose a recipe. Cooking and serving can be done by
			both the chef (your avatar) and any of your undead employees. Select
			a character and then select the stove you would like them to cook
			on. To view the time remaining on a dish, touch the stove.<br />
			<br />
			When your dish is finished cooking, bring it to the serving counter
			by touching your chef or a zombie, and then touching the stove with the
			dish.  If you don't serve a dish, it will burn on the stove.
			<br /><br />
			Zombies can cook, but will slowly use up their energy while cooking.
			A cooking dish needs to be attended to by a zombie or your chef for as long as it takes to finish.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Always make sure you have something cooking to ensure you have enough food to serve.  Cooking is also the best way to gain XP and level up your caf&#233;.
		</li>

		<a name="recipes"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Recipes</h3>
			You can touch your recipe book or a stove to view your recipes.
			Recipes vary greatly in their costs and rewards.  Some are quick and cheap,
			and others are expensive and take days to cook - you don't need to wait around
			and watch, but make sure you've got enough for your customers in the mean time.
			<br />
			<br />
			You can get new recipes by leveling up, stealing food from enemy caf&#233;s, and ordering from friends. Stolen dishes, dishes made for friends and dishes received from friends are stored in the fridge. Touch the fridge at any time to see its contents. Ordered food in the fridge can also be discarded, if necessary.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Stealing food during raids and ordering from friends can unlock rare/special versions of recipes that are often more valuable than their normal counterparts. Each of these special versions have different bonuses, but it's not always obvious. If you have
			a dish in your fridge that has an UNLOCK button, it means you don't have that recipe - it's wise to UNLOCK it rather than serve it.
		</li>

		<a name="serving"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Serving</h3>
			Select a zombie (or your chef) and touch a serving counter or table to have them serve customers.
			While they're serving, workers will automatically take dishes to waiting customers and clear dirty dishes.
			<br /><br />
			You don't need to tell servers what to do, but you need to make sure they've got a clear path to every table, serving counter, and sink.
			If a server can't reach a table they won't serve customers who sit there.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Like cooking, zombies use energy to serve. However, the more servers you have the less work it is for each of them - you'll serve customers faster and use less energy.
		</li>

		<a name="customers"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Customers</h3>
			Customers will visit your caf&#233; looking for a meal.  If they leave happy, they'll give you money and improve your star rating (leading to more customers).
			If they can't find a clean table to sit at, or wait too long to be served, they'll leave unhappy - lowering your rating.
			<br /><br />
			Selecting a customer will show you their name. If you have room for another zombie, you can touch the INFECT button to turn them into a zombie.
			The type of customer you choose to infect will affect how good they are at working in the caf&#233;.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Watch customers (and touch the INFO button to see their bio) to get
			clues as to their individual strengths and weaknesses. As your caf&#233; advances different customers will arrive - keep your eyes peeled!
		</li>

		<a name="zombies"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Zombies</h3>
			Selecting a zombie will show you their name, energy bar, and
			their current status (cooking, serving, resting, etc.) If your
			zombie's energy is low, you can press the REST button to give them
			a break while their energy recovers. You can also revitalize them
			instantly by pressing ENERGIZE to spend a vial of toxin.
			<br /><br />
			While they're selected, touching a stove, table, serving counter or the work button will
			immediately put them back to work.  Selecting the INFO button will
			bring up your zombie's bio and allow you to fire them. Zombies will
			gain experience by serving and raiding friends and enemies. When a
			zombie levels up, its maximum energy will increase. Zombies will
			not always stay on task or prioritize - sometimes they'll daydream
			or fall asleep! So be prepared to remind them once in a while what
			they should be doing. Tired zombies (zombies with low energy) are
			more likely to make mistakes or try to eat the customers.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Try your zombies in different roles to see what works best.
			Some zombies have more energy, some are stronger, some are faster, some get more tips,
			some are better at staying on task and not attacking your customers.
		</li>
		<a name="Tombstones"></a>
		<li>
		<h3>Tombstones</h3>
				Tombstones are used to give your zombie horde special bonuses, when placed outside your caf&#233;.
			<br /><br />
			During a raid, touch a tombstone icon to give all of your zombies that bonus for five seconds. Only one type of bonus can be used at a time, and while that bonus is in effect, the zombies will glow the color of the tombstone. Each standard tombstone can be used a maximum of five times, before requiring 24 hours to regenerate.
		</li>
		<a name="customization"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>The Store</h3>
			Select the shopping bag icon in the top left corner of the caf&#233;
			screen to view store items. Drag left or right, or tap the red
			arrows, to view items. Touch or drag an item to place it in your caf&#233;, and press purchase to buy it.
			You can touch and hold items in your caf&#233; to move them later, and drag them back into the store to sell them.
			<br /><br />
			Some of the items will be locked until your caf&#233; is a higher level.
			<br /><br />
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>
			<strong>Cash Items</strong><br />
			Items with dollar sign symbols will accumulate cash on their own.
			A dollar sign or an exclamation point will appear above an item when it has cash available, and tapping it will add some cash to your total.
			Items with an exclamation point are full and cannot accumulate any more cash until they've been emptied.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Popularity Items</strong><br />
			Items with star symbols will help your star rating increase faster and decrease slower. Like cash items, the more stars, the better.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Toxin Barrels</strong><br />
			Toxin barrels help your zombies regain energy faster.  You can have more than one barrel to increase the effect.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Caf&#233; Expansions</strong><br />
			Besides items, you can also buy expansions to your caf&#233;.  Adding more room gives you more room
			to serve and customize.  Bigger caf&#233;s can make more money, and faster.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<a name="customization2"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Item Storage</h3>
			Select the crate icon in the top left corner of the caf&#233;
			screen to open up the storaeg tab. Drag left or right, or tap the red
			arrows, to view items. Touch or drag an item to place it in your caf&#233;, and press place to add.
			You can touch and hold items in your caf&#233; to move them later, and drag them back into the crate to store them.
			<br /><br />			
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<a name="multiplayer"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>The Map</h3>
			Scroll left on the map screen to see your friends, and scroll right to see enemy caf&#233;s.<br />
			<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
			<a name="friends"></a><br />
			<li>
			<strong>Friends/Franchises</strong><br />
			You can invite friends to open a franchise by logging
			into your Facebook account through the Main Menu, or by
			selecting "Invite Friends" from the far left of the map screen.
			While in another player's caf&#233;, you can collect franchise fees,
			or order food from them by touching their menu book. You can only order one dish from each friend per day. <br />
			<br>When called upon to cook a dish for a friend, your order chit/clipboard on the left of the screen will have a bouncing "!". Tapping the chit will give you
			the option of filling, or rejecting the order. While visiting a friend's caf&#233;, you can touch the fridge icon to deliver the order (or give them other extra food you might have in your fridge).  The order board will act as a hub allowing you to manage your orders.  The "Pending" tab shows orders that you have not started cooking, "In-Progress will" show orders that currently occupy stove space and the "Deliver" tab will show orders that are ready to be sent. While in your own caf&#233;, cooked orders will appear in your fridge with the name of the intended recipient. If you can't deliver the dish or decide you just want it for yourself, you can use the "serve" button to serve it in your caf&#233;.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Ordering food from friends is a great way of unlocking valuable and rare recipes you don't yet have.  Filling orders is a great way to get quick cash and share recipes with friends.
			<br />
			If yours or your friends' caf&#233;s appear greenish on the map, it means they're under investigation by the Zombie Labor Union. You won't be able to visit them until the investigation is complete.
			<br />
			</li>
			<a name="raids"></a><br />
			<li>
			<strong>Enemy Caf&#233;s/Raids</strong><br />
			After selecting a caf&#233; to raid, touch each zombie
			and then the ATTACK button if you want them to go on a
			general rampage. If you want them to attack a specific
			person, or steal food, tap the zombie and then your
			target. Tap the retreat button (the white flag in the top right) to have your zombies try to escape.
			<br /><br />
			If you defeat an enemy caf&#233;, it will be forced to close, but a new restaurant will open in its place after a while. If an enemy caf&#233; is allowed to operate in your area for too long, it will start to steal your customers!</dd>
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Raiding enemy caf&#233;s is another great way to get valuable and rare recipes.  You also have a chance of winning Toxin!
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<a name="bossfight"></a>
			<li>
			<strong>Boss Fights</strong><br />
			After level five, an extra enemy caf&#233; will occasionally appear on the map screen. Defeating this special chef will result in a rare recipe. The chances of seeing his caf&#233; will increase with every level, and levels 24 to 26 he'll appear as a regular enemy.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<a name="friendraids"></a>
			<li>
			<strong>Raiding Friends</strong><br />
			You can now raid your friends' caf&#233;s by visiting them and selecting "attack". Your zombies run the same risks, but your friend will not lose anything, even if you are successful. You can only raid one friend per day. A bouncing "!" on your clipboard indicates that you've been raided. Touch it to view the results of the raid.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			</li>
			</ol>

		</li>


		<a name="objectives"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>The Objective System</h3>
			<p>
				Tap the zombie head icon to open the Objectives Screen.
				</p>

				<p>
				To complete an objective, complete all of the tasks on your To-Do list.  You can complete one objective at a time. Completion of an objective will add a purple star to your star rating, which takes longer to disappear from your star rating than a regular star. You can earn a maximum of three purple stars.
				</p>

				<p>
				When completing a task, tap 'Finish' button. When completing an objective, tap the complete button. There are four types of objectives: cooking, social, caf&#233; and raiding.
				</p>

				<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>First Purple Star – 48 hours to expire.</li>
				<li>Second Purple Star – Adds 36 hours to the time remaining before losing a purple star.</li>
				<li>Third Purple Star  – Adds 24 hours to the time remaining before losing a purple star.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				To maintain three purple stars, continue completing objectives within 24 hours. Each additional objective will earn you an additional 24 hours before your purple stars expire, up to a maximum of one week (168 hours).
				</p>

				<p>
				<b>Bribe the Reviewer:</b>
				<br>You can also spend two toxins to auto-complete any task.

		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
			<a name="Q1"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I add people to my friends list?</dt>
			<dd>
				Any friends you have on Facebook that have the application will be automatically added. You can manage your list of friends by selecting "Friends" 	from the Main Menu.
			</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q2"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>Will my caf&#233; earn money while the app is closed?</dt>
			<dd>It will now! Your caf&#233; should now earn money, even when the application is closed. Be careful not to run out of food!</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q3"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I move my furniture/appliances/etc?</dt>
			<dd>Press and hold the item until it is highlighted green, then drag it where you want it to be. Press the arrow to change the orientation of the item. You can also delete items by dragging them into the store while it is open. (You'll get part of the money back.) Chairs can now be rotated more than two directions.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q4"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What happens if all of my food gets piled on one serving counter?</dt>
			<dd>Don't worry! You'll still have the same number of portions (dishes do not overwrite each other); you just won't be able to see all of the dishes at the same time. This may bend the limits of space, and physical reality, but at least you can use one serving counter.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q5"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How long does it take food to burn?</dt>
			<dd>Your dishes will burn if left untouched for a time equal to the cooking time. (Except for the Mystery Meat, which burns in five minutes.)</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q6"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What items earn extra cash?</dt>
			<dd>Items like the ATM or the arcade machine that appear with a dollar sign above them in the store will accumulate money over time. When an exclamation point appears above them, they've reached their maximum capacity and need to be emptied.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q7"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What is the barrel for in special items?</dt>
			<dd>It speeds up the rate at which your zombies regain energy.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q8"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>Why is the zombie union rep telling me my zombies are overworked/Why is that caf&#233; appearing green on the map?</dt>
			<dd>The game has detected a discrepancy between the device clock and the server's.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q9"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I close my caf&#233;?</dt>
			<dd>You can now close your caf&#233; by tapping the door, making it easier to re-arrange your furniture without bothering the customers. Beware though- your star rating will slowly drop while your caf&#233; is closed. (Though it will not drop as fast as when you run out of food.)</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q10"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>Why is my customer running around screaming/Why is my zombie doing nothing?</dt>
			<dd>Be sure that you've left enough space for your customers/employees move around your caf&#233;. You may have blocked them in, or out.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q11"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What happens if I raid my friend's caf&#233;?</dt>
			<dd>Don't worry! Your friends won't actually lose any food, customers or employees. You can raid a friend's caf&#233; once a day.</dd>
