This mobile application ("Game") is licensed, not sold, to you by Beeline Interactive, Inc. ("Beeline").  By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this End-User License Agreement ("EULA").  We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA.  We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition.  Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Apple App Store, Android Market and other mobile application download platforms where the Game is available.  You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game.  Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.

Scope of License 
This EULA is limited to a nontransferable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules for the Apple App Store, Android Market or Amazon Appstore, as applicable, or other terms and conditions applying to your device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the rules relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the rules for your device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Beeline and our licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.
The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by Beeline that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.  You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and Beeline, and not with the provider of your device (for example, Apple and Android), and that Beeline is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA.  If you have an Apple device and this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms of service for such device, the terms of service for such device will govern.
